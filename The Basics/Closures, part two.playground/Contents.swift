//However, Swift knows the parameter to that closure must be a string, so we can remove it:
travelShort { place -> String in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

//It also knows the closure must return a string, so we can remove that:
travelShort { place in
    return "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

//As the closure only has one line of code that must be the one that returns the value, so Swift lets us remove the return keyword too:
travelShort { place in
    "I'm going to \(place) in my car"
}

//Swift has a shorthand syntax that lets you go even shorter. Rather than writing place in we can let Swift provide automatic names for the closureâ€™s parameters. These are named with a dollar sign, then a number counting from 0.
travelShort {
    "I'm going to \($0) in my car"
}

//Shorthand parameters are written as $0, $1 and so on.
//When using shorthand parameters you don't list the parameters you accept.

//Returning closures from functions

func travel() -> (String) -> Void {

}

//We can now call travel() to get back that closure, then call it as a function:

let result = travel()
result("London")

//Itâ€™s technically allowable â€“ although really not recommended! â€“ to call the return value from travel() directly:
let result2 = travel()("London")

//Capturing values
func travelCaptureValue() -> (String) -> Void {
    return {
        print("I'm going to \($0)")
    }
}

//We can call travel() to get back the closure, then call that closure freely:

let resultCaptureValue = travelCaptureValue()
resultCaptureValue("London")

//Closure capturing happens if we create values in travel() that get used inside the closure. For example, we might want to track how often the returned closure is called:

func travelCaptureValues() -> (String) -> Void {
    var counter = 1

    return {
        print("\(counter). I'm going to \($0)")
        counter += 1
    }
}

let resultCaptureValues = travelCaptureValues()
resultCaptureValues("London")

resultCaptureValues("London")
resultCaptureValues("London")
resultCaptureValues("London")

//Youâ€™ve made it to the end of the sixth part of this series, so letâ€™s summarize:

//1. You can assign closures to variables, then call them later on.
//2. Closures can accept parameters and return values, like regular functions.
//3. You can pass closures into functions as parameters, and those closures can have parameters of their own and a return value.
//4. If the last parameter to your function is a closure, you can use trailing closure syntax.
//5. Swift automatically provides shorthand parameter names like $0 and $1, but not everyone uses them.
//6. If you use external values inside your closures, they will be captured so the closure can refer to them later.
