//How to check whether a string is spelled correctly, using UITextChecker.

//Creating animations implicitly using the animation() modifier.

//Customizing animations with delays and repeats, and choosing between ease-in-ease-out vs spring animations.

//Attaching the animation() modifier to bindings, so we can animate changes directly from UI controls.

//Using withAnimation() to create explicit animations.

ForEach(0..<5) {
    Text("Row \($0)")
}

//ForEach(0...5) {
//   Text("Row \($0)")
//}

//That counts from 0 through 5, meaning that it will create six views. Or at least it would create six views if it actually worked â€“ that code doesnâ€™t compile.
